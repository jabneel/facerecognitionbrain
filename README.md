# FaceRecognitionBrain
==========================






Purpose
==========================

The purpose of this project is to show my skills and knowledge in following instructions on how to make a website with basic functionalities. The main function of this website is for the computer to show that it recognizes a person's face from the uploaded image. This repository is the front-end side of FaceRecognitionBrain, for the back-end check my repository, smart-brain-api.


This is a project I followed from Udemy Online Course by Andrei Neagoie.
You can check his github repository @github.com/aneagoie. He is a great teacher and you should definitely check his web course online if you want to become a web developer.
All credits to him for all the code implementation of this project.
