# facerecognitionbrain

This is a project I followed from Udemy Online Course by Andrei Neagoie.
You can check his github repository @github.com/aneagoie. He is a great teacher and you should definitely check his web course online if you want to become a web developer.
All credits to him for all the code implementation of this project.

Check his Udemy Course @ udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery

This web application functions as a face recognition app.
