# facerecognitionbrain

This is a project I followed from Udemy Online Course by Andrei Neagoie.
You can check his github repository @github.com/aneagoie
All credits to him for code implementation.

You can also check his Udemy Course @udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery

This web application functions as a face recognition app.
